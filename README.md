=================Pacman Mode=================

* Initially you will have 3 lives. When you touch a ghost, you lose 1 life. You will lose when you have no life left.
* When you eat 10 cherries, you get strength. At this moment the ghosts will be green and you will have the ability to eat 1 ghost. After eating a ghost, you will lose your power and now the ghosts will be blue (Note that you can only eat the ghost if it is in front of you, otherwise you will still 1 life).
* You will win if you have eaten all the cherries on the screen.

================Bomberman Mode===============

* In this game mode, you will initially have 6 lives. Just like Pacman, you will lose a life if you touch a ghost.
* Use SPACEBAR to place bombs, each bomb will have an explosion radius of 3 units in 4 directions (left, right, top, bottom), the explosion can't go through walls. The bomb will wait 3s and explode for 1s.
* If you get hit by an exploding bomb, you lose instantly. Otherwise, you will lose when there are no lives left.
* You win if you kill all the ghosts.

==================GOOD LUCK==================
